📦 Project Setup

No additional packages needed — solutions run in a browser via `<script>` tags in HTML files or directly in the browser console.

> ⚠️ Note: `prompt()` functions run only in browsers, not in Node.js terminal.

To Run:
- Open each folder.
- Open the respective HTML file (e.g., `chai.html`) with Live Server or in your browser.
- Follow the on-screen prompt instructions.
